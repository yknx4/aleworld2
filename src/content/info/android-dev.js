module.exports = `__Software Engineer__ with passion to solve problems with code, with an obsession on automating stuff, and in love with Meta programing.

I am deeply interested on modern web development, mobile development for **Android**, and Desktop Applications on **.NET** (I've been putting my eyes recently on electron for this).

I'm especially interested in newer and promising technologies like **Nodejs**, **NoSql**, **Ruby/Rails**, **Serverless** among others.

I have been playing with programming since Secondary School, and have tried multiple languages and frameworks. So far liking Javascript/Node.js, Ruby/Rails, C#/.NET and Kotlin/Android the most.
