I'm a supporter of **Social Freedom**, **Internet Rights** and the **LGBT** Community. I have the opinion that _**everyone can and shall live however the f*ck they want**_ as long as they don't harm anyone else's freedom.

I think any society should be free of oppression, and have all their human rights assured regardless of their political, religious, sexual, or whatever position.

I think all those rights should be also preserved and enforced in all the modern environments that are constantly surging in the Internet. (Yep, This means that you should also be able to do whatever you want on the Internet)

And I'm *against Gender Roles* (a byproduct of sexism), I don't think a person can be defined by what society tells them they are supposed to be just because the person was born with or without something between the legs. I consider myself **transgender**, but feel free to address me however you feel you should.
