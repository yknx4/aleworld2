I love to read everything about tech, and I try to hack every single gadget in my hands.

Currently I have a router with tomato-wrt and a raspberry-pi working as my personal server, and customized roms on my Android devices.

I love languages, I really like to learn languages, as now I can handle these:

* **Spanish**: I'm Mexican so....
* **English**: Good enough for living and working - Cambridge FCE B2
* **Korean**: Been learning for 4 years, I have a intermediate level, 난 한국말을 항상 연습 한 중인데 당신이 연습도 하고 싶으하면 매시지를 보내 주세요
* **Japanese**: もう1年間勉強しています :P
